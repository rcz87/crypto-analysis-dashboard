- **AI Engine**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4o for market analysis and self-reflection, including a Stateful AI Signal Engine with self-learning and Natural Language Narrative Enhancement.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporates Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM for predictions, leveraging real OKX data, with a HybridPredictor combining models using an ensemble voting strategy.
- **Telegram Integration**: Enhanced notification system with retry mechanism, professional signal formatting, and anti-spam protection.
- **Smart Money Concept (SMC) Analyzer**: Professional SMC analyzer detecting key concepts (CHoCH, BOS, Order Blocks, FVG, liquidity sweeps, premium/discount zones), with Auto-Context Injection and enhanced pattern recognition.
- **Multi-Timeframe Analyzer**: Analyzes multiple timeframes (15M, 1H, 4H) for signal confirmation.
- **Risk Management Calculator**: Automatic position sizing based on account balance and risk tolerance.
- **Signal Performance Tracker**: Tracks win/loss ratios and analyzes performance.
- **Advanced Alert System**: Rule-based alert filtering with customizable conditions and priority levels, including real-time monitoring and webhook capabilities.
- **Volume Profile Analyzer**: Calculates Point of Control (POC) and Value Area.
- **Multi-Role Agent System**: Includes specialized trading agents (Technical Analyst, Sentiment Watcher, Risk Manager, Trade Executor, Narrative Maker).
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic-based validation for all GPTs endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handlers provide structured error responses and mask internal errors.
- **Security Hardening**: Includes rate limiting, API authentication, secure logging, comprehensive vulnerability remediation, CORS headers, and prompt injection defense.
- **Crypto News Analyzer**: Real-time crypto news sentiment analysis using GPT-4o.
- **Authenticated OKX API Integration**: Fully integrated with authentic OKX API credentials for maximum capacity access, supporting 16 timeframes, 1440 candles per request, enhanced rate limits, and optimized cache.
- **Enterprise-Grade Systems**: Includes Explainable AI Engine, Advanced Data Validation Pipeline, Overfitting Prevention System, Data Sanity Checker, and Self-Improvement Engine.
- **Data Quality Enhancement System**: Enterprise-grade 3-component system including Market Anomaly Detector (8 anomaly types), Multi-Source Data Manager (5 exchanges with automatic failover), and Historical Data Completeness Checker.
- **Security Hardening System**: Comprehensive enterprise-grade security framework including SecurityManager (rate limiting, input sanitization, IP filtering, encrypted storage), AuditLogger (tamper-proof logging with HMAC-SHA256 signatures), and real-time injection detection.
- **Performance Optimization Engine**: Comprehensive system with SmartCache (6 cache types), AsyncTaskProcessor (parallel processing), ResponseOptimizer (pagination, compression), PerformanceMonitor (real-time metrics), and SystemResourceMonitor.
- **Signal Engines**: Features an "Enhanced Signal Engine" (weight matrix) and a "Sharp Signal Engine" (AI reasoning, SMC, risk management) providing comprehensive market analysis with confidence levels and transparent reasoning.
- **Sharp Scoring System**: Simple and effective scoring system with threshold â‰¥70 for identifying high-quality signals using a weighted formula combining technical analysis (SMC, orderbook, momentum, volume) with enhancement factors (LuxAlgo alignment, CoinGlass factors).
- **Prompt Book Blueprint**: Dedicated Flask blueprint for clean API management with specific endpoints for ChatGPT Custom GPT compatibility.
- **SMC Zones Endpoint**: Comprehensive SMC zones data for chart visualization with filtering and proximity alerts.
- **Keep-Alive**: Anti-sleep system with self-ping mechanism.
