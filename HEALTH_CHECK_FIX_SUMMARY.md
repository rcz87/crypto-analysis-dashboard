# ðŸ”§ Health Check Database Connection Fix

## Problem Analysis
VPS database health check was failing because it was using fallback logic to `psycopg2.connect()` with environment variables that were not properly passed to the application context, causing connections to `localhost:5432` with wrong credentials.

## Root Cause
- Health check had multiple fallback approaches including direct psycopg2.connect
- When SQLAlchemy wasn't available in the expected way, it fell back to environment variables
- Environment variables weren't properly accessible within the application context
- This caused connections to default PostgreSQL (localhost:5432) instead of Neon

## Solution Implemented
âœ… **Single Source of Truth**: Use only `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` from Flask config  
âœ… **No Fallbacks**: Removed psycopg2.connect fallback logic  
âœ… **Direct Engine Creation**: Create SQLAlchemy engine directly from config  
âœ… **Proper Error Handling**: Clear error messages for configuration issues  
âœ… **Connection Management**: Proper engine disposal to prevent leaks

## Files Modified
- `routes/health.py` - Main health check endpoint
- `routes.py` - Secondary health check logic
- `scripts/fix_health_check.sh` - Deployment script

## Expected Result After Fix
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "components": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "SQLAlchemy connection successful"
    },
    "okx_api": {
      "status": "healthy", 
      "message": "OKX API connection successful"
    }
  },
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

## Deployment Command for VPS
```bash
bash scripts/fix_health_check.sh
```

## Benefits
- Guaranteed use of correct Neon database configuration
- No more fallback to localhost PostgreSQL
- Consistent database connection logic across all health checks
- Better error reporting and debugging capabilities
- Proper connection lifecycle management
